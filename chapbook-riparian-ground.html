							<p>Lately, my husband and I’ve been out walking together.  Two walks that mix in my memory are a women’s march a couple years ago (Womxn’s it was named in my city) and a day spent strolling the newly revealed riparian banks of the Elwha, a peninsula rain forest river that again, after 100 years, flows unimpeded by dams: from its alpine mountains down and out through a broadening mouth into the Pacific.</p>
							<p>I realize now the feelings stirred in me from being within the human flow of the march are the same stirred by walking the newly exposed riparian ground of the river: feelings of an opening possible; of a chance in a revealed ground once underwater, denied light, held dormant.</p>
							<p>For me, an OldPromise is blooming in the riparian banks of that river & that march.  A yearning lean toward light and life.</p>
							<p>I don’t forget, do not overlook the predatory, invasive species immediately colonizing the newly exposed mud banks of the Elwha.  I know it took the careful, observant labor & time of the river keepers to pull out by the roots, one by one, those fast-growing opportunists and plant in their place native growth.  I understand it is not enough to only reveal the mud. Cultivating care is needed to encourage life from long submergence.</p>
							<p>In the flow of that march was a woman-multitude of currents, temperatures, stridencies & shout outs that came and went, much different and sometimes contradictory but welcoming witnessed, still.</p>
							<p>Our walking was not a toleration - not an indulgent motherhood – but a comprehension of this necessary mashup given flow from the centrifugal attraction that flooded the differences between us as we shared the comfort & encouragement of our invisibility made visible in the light shining from/on our plural mass.</p>
							<p>My husband and I recently checked back in on The Elwha.  The return of life in the riparian zone has begun; a return of a nurturing tributary-ness rippling out to all the plants and animals on and on into the forest. Our chain of interdependent life.  All being in relation.</p>
							<p>That day, wewomen all walking together, the relational meaning held, moving, changing, in the flow of the whole.  Our once submerged ground, revealed.</p>
