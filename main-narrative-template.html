				<p>MAKES FOR AN UNEASY MALESELF</p>
				<p>I’m aware this decoupling from the oldstories is a most difficult & dangerous crossing as the path here leads into/through the not yet known.  And heaven knows, we humans love the certainty of well-signed, trodden paths.</p>
				<p>I am aware of, and also have some worry over the sense of loss many of us feel, particularly the loss felt around male identity -  as “solids” once stood upon or defined against are dissolving.  I know we are not often at our best when uncertain about who we are.</p>
				<p>But then, that's what's ahead of us now. Isn't it? Learning to stand on fluid ground. And as I say, that fluidness is understood as a welcome opportunity by many of us.</p>

			<p id="event0" class="main-memory-mother event-fade text-insert align-right">For everything besides bookkeeping and addresses, we still used manual typewriters. They were cheap and abundant back then. You know, the kind you see now in movies to signify a more "authentic" way of a character's being.</p>
